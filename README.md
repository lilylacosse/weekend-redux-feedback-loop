# Redux Feedback Loop

I created a feedback form using React, Redux, and Node.js. This feedback form specifically is for Prime Digital Academy but could be re-factored to fit any company's desired feedback. 

It was wonderful to work with Redux. 

## Description

This form saves user feedback to a database after it has been approved for submittal. While simple, I was able to practice creating React component, storing state locally in a component, and most excitingly, store state in a more global manor via Redux. I also implemented Material UI for the first time which was enjoyable.
