# Redux Feedback Loop

I created a feedback form using React, Redux, and Node.js. This feedback form specifically is for Prime Digital Academy but could be re-factored to fit any company's desired feedback. 

It was wonderful to work with Redux. 

## Instructions

To run this application, you will need to fork and clone this repo.

Once that is complete, set up the PostgreSQL database. 
I ran mine via Postico localhost. 
The database name and SQL queries can be found in the data.sql file. 

Then, in your terminal, run the commands:
npm install
npm run server 
npm run client

The last command will bring up a tab in your browser, through which you can navigate the app. 

Thanks for taking a look at my work! You rock. 

## Description

This form saves user feedback to a database after it has been approved for submittal. While simple, I was able to practice creating React component, storing state locally in a component, and most excitingly, store state in a more global manor via Redux. I also implemented Material UI for the first time which was enjoyable.
